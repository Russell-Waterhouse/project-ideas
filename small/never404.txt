# Never404
Tired of clicking links on a website that lead nowhere? Tired of updating your website and wondering if there are any remaining links to the page you 
just deleted? 
Just run the never404 script and immediately your entire website will be crawled, and every link that returns a 404 error will be printed, along with 
the link's location.
