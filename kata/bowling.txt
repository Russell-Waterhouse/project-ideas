BOWLING

Simply write a module that correctly scores a game of 10-pin bowling. 
You will need to define data types and structures to represent 
rolls, frames, and the game. 

You will need to write tests to ensure that the game logic is 
implemented correctly. 

You do not need to implement any I/O. There is no need for this 
kata to read a file or interact with the command line.
