FILE ENCRYPTION

Encryption is a very important part of today's modern computer infrastructure. 
Encrypting data at rest or in transit is a very important thing!

Your task is as follows: create a cli (command line interface) tool that encrypts or 
decrypts files based on your favourite encryption algorithm (you get to decide this one)
You can NOT use a library to complete the encryption. 

Your program should take the following arguments: 
  -d    decrypt mode
  -e    encrypt mode
  -k    encryption key, presented as a file
  -f    path to file


An example use of this tool might be
  $ ./myEncryptor -e -k key.txt -f /Documents/plaintext.txt

The output should be a file named plaintext.txt.ENCRYPTED

To retrieve the original file, you should be able to use the command 
  $ ./myEncryptor -d -k key.txt -f /Documents/plaintext.txt

You should also be able to check your work with the help of 



DISCLAIMER: 
  While it is important to understand how encryption works and 
  to be able to use it, it is not recommended to use an encryption library
  that you create yourself in any situation that the encryption is actually 
  a requirement. 

  The reason for this while the mathematics behind encryption may be 
  strong, flaws in your implementation may leave you open to attacks.

  Instead, use an open source encryption library that has been tested by
  security professionals who understand what they are doing. 

  I repeat: DO NOT ROLL YOUR OWN ENCRYPTION IN PRODUCTION.
