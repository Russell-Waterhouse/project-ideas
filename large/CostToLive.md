# Cost to Live

I'm thinking of building a web app that calculates the cost to live in any given community in Canada.  
Originally, the idea was just to scrape housing prices and aggregate them, but that's now ballooned to calculate the cost of 
food, transportation (gasoline or public transit), and subtract the average salary of the area. 

To be clear, this is a massive project, it barely fits within the large category
