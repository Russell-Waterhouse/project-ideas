# Cost to Live

I'm thinking of building a web app that calculates the cost to live in any given community in Canada.  
Originally, the idea was just to scrape housing prices and aggregate them, but that's now ballooned to calculate the cost of 
food, transportation (gasoline or public transit), and subtract the average salary of the area. 

# Tools I plan to use
The only reason I'm choosing this stack is that these are technologies I want to use. 
Most of this technology is not needed for the scale that this web app will actually work at. 

## Frontend
Tailwind CSS
TypeScript
React

## API

## Backend
