# SAFETY ANALYSIS

The prospect of this projest is very simple: build the same project over and over with different methodologies and technologies to see what combination 
produces the most safe product. This is to be used as a reference by professionals working on safety-critical systems. 

It will also be a good avenue to explore what methods of analyzing the safety of a product are most effective in finding the faults. 

This is a very rough sketch of a project idea, and I'll be filling it out in more detail in the future.
